The `images` folder contains a collection of visuals illustrating different stages of the 3D path-generation process.  
It includes:
- the **initial raw path**,  
- its **filtered version**,  
- and the **final smoothed path**.  

Additionally, the folder provides a photo of the **laboratory environment** from which the map and the simulation setup were derived.
